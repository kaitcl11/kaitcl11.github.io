    <p> As a dedicated English student with exposure to Professional Writing, I possess strong written and verbal communication skills and a learned understanding of connecting with a broad audience. My courses over the semesters have given me the skill set to reach out to an audience through all modes of verbal and written communication. My proficiency with Microsoft programs, WordPress, and other platforms of communication allow me to excel in digital communication, as well as in the writing of proposals and reports.   </p>
    <p> Upon graduation in May of this year, I would like to return to DC and enter the area of Policy Development. I believe the skill-set I have developed throughout my undergraduate career, as well as through my professional experiences, would make this a beneficial fit for me and an employer.
