    <p>  "Just an English major trying to redefine the degree." English majors are renowned
		for receiving the question, "Oh so you'd like to be a teacher?" and that is a trend I'd like to change.
	 	My passion for literature and the underlying cultural and historical patterns that can be found
	in every work pairs well with my passion for Policy. I think it is extremely necessary to look into the past
	in order to shape the future.  </p>
	<br> </br>
		<p> As a dedicated English student with exposure to Professional Writing, I possess strong written and verbal communication skills and a learned understanding of connecting with a broad audience. My courses over the semesters have given me the skill set to reach out to an audience through all modes of verbal and written communication. My proficiency with Microsoft programs, WordPress, and other platforms of communication allow me to excel in digital communication, as well as in the writing of proposals and reports.   </p>
		<br> </br>
    <p> Upon graduation in May of this year, I would like to return to DC and enter the area of Policy Development. I believe the skill-set I have developed throughout my undergraduate career, as well as through my professional experiences, would make this a beneficial fit for me and my future employer. </p>
